## Brief

At the end of every course is a course assignment. The Introduction Course Assignment won't count for marks, but is useful to practice the process of delivering as well as giving you an opportunity to meet and engage with your fellow students.

For this course assignment you're going to need to introduce yourself to your classmates on Discord, and write a reflective post on your thoughts as you start your studies

## Level 1 Process

1. A link to Discord was sent in your welcoming email from a student success manager. Go to your class channel on Discord (i.e. 2022-august-full-time, 2022-october-part-time). Write a presentation of yourself including things like your background, location and interests. There are also location-based channels for cities and areas around Norway, so ask your teachers to add you to the channel for your location.

2. In the interest of getting to know other students, it is important that we take advantage of the user profile on Moodle. Provide a picture or an avatar, and write about yourself and your interests, so that tutors and fellow students get to know you. This could for instance be a shorter version of what you posted on Discord.

3. Write a reflective post discussing why you chose this study and what you're hoping to get out of it. What has your experience of the introduction been? You can use Microsoft Word or Google Docs or any other word processor to write the post.

4. Style your reflective post. You can choose fonts, colors, backgrounds, whatever you'd like to use to add your personality to the design of the post.

5. Save the post as a PDF, and share the post on the 'Peer Feedback' forum on Moodle. Giving peer feedback is a very important skill to build, and getting peer feedback is a great opportunity to improve your own work. [Here's a video](https://vimeo.com/725636332/cbd43c66d6) with suggestions for giving peer feedback. You will need to submit your post for feedback and give feedback to at least two students before you can access the delivery on Moodle.

6. Make any adjustments based on the feedback you've received and submit to Moodle.
