## Brief

An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants a website that is informative and appealing, that will attract both middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is inquisitive and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, but should encourage viewers to visit the museum itself. The website should be responsive and be easy to use on a variety of devices.

You have been provided media assets in the form of text and images (see link under Resources). It is for you to decide how these will be used, in terms of presentation, hierarchy, and design.

## Project Description

**Target Audience & Design**: The target audience should be carefully considered, and the proposed design should reflect this. A prototype of the website should be made using your chosen software (Adobe XD, Figma etc.)

**Final Product**: A URL and zip file with the final website should be submitted. The site should be tested on a variety of devices before final delivery. The student has responsibility for setting up their own web host, or using Netlify to deploy the site. GitHub repositories should be set to private.

**Report**: Submit a report discussing the design and technical aspects of the project, as well as how guidelines for WCAG, SEO and content management were handled. A template for this report is provided under ‘Resources’.
