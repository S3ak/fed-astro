Interaction design is a discipline that focuses on designing digital products and services with the user's experience and behavior in mind. It involves designing the ways in which users interact with a digital system, including the visual and functional aspects of the product or service.

The goal of interaction design is to create products and services that are intuitive, easy to use, and provide a positive user experience. Interaction designers work to identify user needs, goals, and tasks, and then create interfaces and interactions that help users achieve those goals in the most efficient and enjoyable way possible.

Interaction design involves a wide range of skills and knowledge, including user research, usability testing, visual design, information architecture, and prototyping. The ultimate aim of interaction design is to create products and services that are not only functional and usable but also delightful and engaging to use.
