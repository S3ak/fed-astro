## Brief

In this assignment you will work on your cross-course project to:

- Ensure that the website is user-centric.

- Ensure that the website is focused on helping users achieve their goals clearly and simply.

### Level 1 Process

- Look over the data collected from Hotjar and determine whether there are any aspects of the site that could cause problems for users. Consider conducting further contextual inquiry interviews. These interviews will allow you to see users interacting with the site in-person.

- Perform accessibility testing on your website to ensure it’s easy to use for users with accessibility issues.

- Decide on which areas of the site to focus and then improve the interactions for users.

- Use your skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to improve the website.

- Once you’ve added your changes, test the site with at least one more user (preferably 3-5). Gain feedback from the user and determine whether the changes you’ve made have improved the issues on the website.

- Write a report detailing the research you conducted during this course, and include the changes you made to your website.

### Requirements

Because your sites will all have slightly different designs, the areas that need improvement will be different. But by the end of the course assignment, you should have at least updated the following:

- The purchase/cart functionality

- The contact form with JavaScript validation

### Submission

- Link to the updated website.

- A report covering the research conducted and the updates made to the site.
