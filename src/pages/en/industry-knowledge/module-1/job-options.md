## Introduction

This lesson contains an activity on the last page that you should complete.

Taking the skills you’ve learned in your studies and moving into the workplace can be daunting. This course will give you the insights into what to expect from web development and how best to get a job in the industry.

## Work Environment

There are three main environments that you’re likely to work in as a front-end developer:

- An agency which has multiple clients and projects all at different stages of development. You would work in a team with graphic designers, copywriters, other developers etc. The agency would be hired on a contract-basis, with a number of different projects, timelines and scales.

- In-house jobs are where you would work for a single organization. Development is not the primary focus of the organisation, but is important enough for them to maintain their own team to work on their own projects. An example might be an e-commerce site with their own development team.

- A freelancer works for themselves and finds their own projects and clients.

Working as a freelancer offers a lot of flexibility to choose your own schedule and take on projects that interest you. The negative is that you don’t have a set salary, so income can vary from month-to-month.

If you want variety, then an agency is a good place to go. You’ll get to work with a number of different clients and briefs. Agencies tend to have fixed deadlines and traffic managers ensure that each project is moving through the organization speedily and that work isn’t bottlenecking with anyone.

In-house teams offer a bit more stability and room to grow and develop, but there is less variety as you are working for one company. Depending on the size of the company you might work on a range of tasks within the organization and would need to learn a wider range of skills. Because you’d be working in-house they are likely to have more formal procedures for career advancement.

## Job Titles

As you are studying Front-end Development, most of you will be looking to move into this role. But some of you might have found other areas of web development more interesting, like UX-design for example.

Here are a list of common jobs in the web development industry:

### Front-end developer

A developer who works with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some jobs may have specific names like JavaScript Developer or React Developer, and show how that will be the main focus of the position.

### Back-end Developer

A back-end developer focuses on server/databases. They use specific languages suited to this including Ruby, PHP, C#, Python etc.

### Full Stack Developer

A full stack developer is someone with understanding of both the front-end and the back-end. In reality most good front-end developers will know some back-end, and vice versa. And with tools like MongoDB, developers writing JavaScript are finding it easier to bridge this gap.

### UI Designer

A User Interface Designer focuses specifically on the design that the user is shown. They are less concerned with how something will be developed and, compared to a UX designer, are less concerned about why the design is chosen.

### UX Designer

A User Experience Designer focusses on why a site is designed the way it is. They focus on user testing and researching to ensure the final product is one that is correct. For anyone interested, this is Noroff's UX Design course.

### Information Architect

Works to create a logical structure for the website. They might also be called Content Strategists, and find the best way of communicating with the user.

## What makes a good Front-end Developer

Front-end development is an ever changing field, and that is what makes it so exciting. To be a good front-end developer you should be adaptable and constantly learning and trying new things. You should be curious and interested in improving yourself and the code that you write.

It’s good to have a wide variety of interests and knowledge, but to still specialize in only a few areas and technologies. That gives you the ability to be very proficient in one area, but able to understand how it will impact other areas in a project.

Another common trait amongst developers is their enjoyment of problem solving, and a lot of your time as a front-end developer will be wrestling with problems. Running into problems shouldn’t be seen as a failure, but an opportunity to learn something new and further your skills.

Front-end developers should also be good at working in teams. If you get a job in an organization with a development team, you will need to get used to sharing your work with others, and having them share their work with you. You might have code reviews where people will look over the code you’ve written. This might some awkward at first, but it’s there to improve your code and save you time in the long run. Sometimes an issue you’ve been struggling with is easily spotted by an outside viewpoint.
