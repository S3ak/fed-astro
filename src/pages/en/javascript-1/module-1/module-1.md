In this module we will:

- Begin by looking at some core concepts we will use throughout our JavaScript studies such as using the console, const and let variables, creating strings with backticks and functions as properties of objects.
- Examine what the DOM is and how to manipulate it.
- Look at what JSON is and how it is sent from API calls and see how we can create HTML from objects.
- Look at function arguments and return values, and how to create HTML inside a function.
