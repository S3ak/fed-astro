## Introduction

In this lesson, we examine fetching and displaying a single result from an API call. We also look at filtering data using the filter() method.

## Displaying a single result

Sometimes we retrieve only a single result from an API call. In this case, we will work with a single object rather than an array of objects.

Because we are not working with an array, we access the result properties directly.

## Filter method

If you want to filter the data displayed to a user, you can use the filter method. The filter method is used to create a new array from an existing array that the filter method is called on.

The filter method takes a function as an argument. This function receives each item in the array as an argument. If the function returns true, the item is added to the new array.

## Filter example

In the video below, the filter method is used to filter a static array of objects on a keyup event.

### Filter example with API data

The video below builds on the one above, adding data from an API call and moving the code into reusable functions.

## Find method

The find method is similar to the filter method, though it only returns a single item (or undefined) rather than an array of items.
