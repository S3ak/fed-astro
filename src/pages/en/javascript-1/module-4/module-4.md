In this module, we begin with the most critical part of making API calls: examining the JSON they return.

We also look at:

- Skipping certain objects when looping over an array of objects.
- Fetching and displaying a single result from an API call.
- Retrieving parameters from the query string.
- Passing variables to other pages in the query string.
- Regular expressions.
- Preventing the default behaviour of forms.
- Simple form validation.
