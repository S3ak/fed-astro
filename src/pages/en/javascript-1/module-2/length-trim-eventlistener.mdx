## Introduction

In this lesson we will look at:

- the length property and trim() method.
- the addEventListener function.
- the onkeyup event.

## length and trim()

We can use the length property to count the number of characters in a string.

The trim() method is used to remove the spaces at the beginning and end of strings.
