## Introduction

In this lesson we will look at:

- what DOM events are.
- the click event.
- the remainder operator.
- the onchange event.

## Introduction to Events

When something happens in the browser - such as a page loading, a form being submitted or a user clicking a button, the DOM sends an Event.

We can write code to respond to that event.

Some examples of events include:

- **click** - when the mouse button is clicked
- **keydown** - when any key is pressed
- **keyup** - when any key is released
- **mouseover** - when the mouse cursor moves over a DOM element or its children elements
- **mouseout** - when the mouse cursor moves off an element
- **submit** - when a form is submitted

You can find a full list of events [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).

An event is an object with properties.

The video below is an introduction to DOM events and the click event in particular.

## The remainder operator

The remainder operator %, sometimes referred to as the modulus operator, returns the remaining integer value after dividing two integers:

```js
const remainder = 5 % 2;
// remainder will equal 1
```

## The onchange event

The following video looks at the onchange event of a select element and how to create HTML inside that event function.

```js
const myDomElement = document.querySelector("input");

myDomElement.addEventListener("change", function () {
  console.log("The value of the input has changed");
});
```

## Example with setTimeout

In the next a video, a setTimeout function is used to mimic a loading state when creating the HTML.
