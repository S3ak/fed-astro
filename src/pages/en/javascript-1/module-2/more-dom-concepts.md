## Introduction

In this lesson we will look at:

- event bubbling.
- data attributes.
- adding event handlers in a loop.
- the mouseover and mouseout events.
- the scroll event.

## Event bubbling

Events "bubble up" through the DOM. This video explores what that means.

## Data attributes

Data attributes are a way to store information (or values) on DOM elements.

We will look at how to use them in the Scrimba in the next section.

## Adding event handlers in a loop

[This Scrimba looks at data attributes and adding click event handlers to a variable number of elements using a loop.](https://scrimba.com/scrim/c36wvqh8)

## mouseover and mouseout events

The following Scrimba looks at the mouseover and mouseout events and then provides an example of using them together with data attributes.

## scroll event

Here we'll look at the window.scroll event using a practical example.
