## Introduction

In this lesson we will look at functions as arguments - passing functions into functions.

This is something that happens frequently. Functions get passed into other functions and are executed inside the receiving function.

We will first take a look at how that works, and then discuss practical implementations of this pattern when looking at:

- forEach method
- setTimeout method
- setInterval method

## Functions as arguments

These are often called **callbacks**. It is very common to pass functions as arguments to other functions and have the receiving function execute them.

## forEach method

The **forEach** method (function) is an alternative to the **for** loop.

When you use a forEach function, you will pass in a function to be executed by the forEach function for each item in the array you are looping over.

It does have some limitations though, such as the inability to use **break** or **continue**.

## setTimeout

The setTimeout method is used to execute a function after a specified period.

It has the following structure:

```js
setTimeout(function () {
    // do something},
1000);
```

It has two required arguments:

1. the function to be executed.
2. the delay - the delay in milliseconds before the function is executed.

## SetInterval

The setInterval method is similar to setTimeout but it executes a function at a certain interval until it is cleared.

It has the following structure:

```js
setInterval(function () {
  // do something
}, 1000);
```
