In this module we will:

- look at callback functions, forEach loops, and delayed code execution using setTimeout and setInterval.
- examine what DOM events are and look at practical examples of them in use.
- use string methods and properties on the values received from DOM events, and look at event bubbling, data attributes, and adding click event handlers to a variable number of elements using a loop.
