## Introduction

As a developer, you will have to maintain a level of professionalism. This extends past writing code. We need to document our apps so that other developers can run the code without any issues. We also need to keep a professional-looking portfolio so that others have confidence in us and the work that we do.

## Your portfolio website

A portfolio website is a great way to showcase your work in a curated way. Not only can you show off the past projects you’ve done, but you can use the portfolio website itself to show your skills. It’s a good idea to create the website on its own domain as this looks more professional to potential employers.

Just like every website, it’s important to follow good design principles. Identify your target audience and their goals. What is the persona of someone looking at your portfolio website, and what are they looking to achieve? Make it as easy as possible for your potential employer to find what they’re looking for.

In this assignment, you will be documenting three prior submissions from the first year:

- Any other project you have done before.
- Semester Project 1
- Project Exam 1

You will be creating a README.md file at the root of each of these projects and then documenting the submissions following a given format.

You will then also be creating a README.md for your own personal GitHub profile.

Lastly, you will be creating a portfolio webpage that lists these 3 projects.

This page must:

- List the 3 projects as cards
- Each card must have:
  - the title of the project,
  - a description,
  - a screenshot of how the project looks when running,
  - a link to the GitHub repo and a live site if it is online.

### Show your personality

It’s a good idea to reveal some of your personality on the site. Your portfolio should reflect you and what you are like to work with. Don’t go with an overly serious or overly friendly tone. Imagine that you’re discussing the work you’ve done with your peers, and use that to guide your tone.

### Showcase your process

It can be a good idea to show some of your processes and how you go about solving development tasks. Make sure it’s engaging and informative, but for potential employers, it’s great to understand how you might work in their team.

### Showcase your skills

In the way you build the portfolio site, you can show your design and development skills. Make bold choices to show what you can do, but don’t show off too much and ensure they integrate neatly into the site.

Be honest about the skills you have. Potential employers are aware that you will be strong in some areas and less strong in others. It’s fine to make this clear, and it will save you headaches in the long run.

It’s a good idea to include links to your GitHub account and other project-sharing sites like Behance.

## Level 1 Process

- Create a README.md in each of the submissions if one doesn’t exist.
- Copy the template found here, making sure to populate it with your own information: https://github.com/NoroffFEU/portfolio-1-example/blob/main/README.md. Feel free to use any other popular templates on the internet if you prefer the way they’ve done it, however, these templates will need to have multiple sections.
- Push the changes when done.
- Follow this GitHub guide and create your own GitHub profile README.md: https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme. Consider googling “GitHub profiles” for some inspiration.
  Push the changes when done.
- Create a personal portfolio webpage that lists the 3 projects as cards. These cards must have a screenshot of the project and a link to the GitHub repo for that project. This must be done on a public repo on your personal GitHub account. You are free to use whatever tech stack you’d like. The page must look good and be responsive. Consider using GitHub pages to host it, otherwise, you can use Netlify or Vercel.
- Submit the links to all three projects on GitHub, a link to your personal portfolio on GitHub, and the portfolio webpage that you’ve made.

## Required Delieverables

- [ ] A link to your deployment production portfolio webpage (Netlify/ Vercel/ GitHub Pages)
- [ ] A link to your Public cross-course project GitHub repo
- [ ] A link to your Public Semester Project 1 GitHub repo
- [ ] A link to your Public Project Exam 1 GitHub repo
- [ ] A detailed README document
- [ ] A link to your personal GitHub profile.
