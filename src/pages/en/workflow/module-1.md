## Introduction

Throughout your career as a student and later as a developer, you will develop your own `Workflow` to tackle various tasks. This unique workflow will undoubtedly include many other workflows that you have learnt and heuristics you have developed yourself. Your workflow is a patchwork of useful problem-solving tools, methods and strategies that accumulate over time.

In this module, we will be taking a closer look at a tool you will have used already for tracking project changes and delivering assignments: `Git`.

Git is a powerful and elegant tool that can provide major benefits to developers if used correctly. It is also an industry standard and something that you will be expected to know in the workplace.
