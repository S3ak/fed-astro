## Introduction

There are many positive ways to streamline, stimulate or fortify your workflow, as there are bad habits and undesirable behaviours that should be avoided. In this module, we will examine the concept of the Working Environment, which can be thought of as the _home_ of a workflow.

We will look at how to create, configure and automate our environment to provide useful tool chains that effortlessly improve our work. The purpose of task automation is to reduce the amount of repetitive or non-creative tasks while developing software. This not only makes us more effective, but happier and more fulfilled developers.
