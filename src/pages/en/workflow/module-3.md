## Introduction

Testing is a process we all engage in while developing to confirm that what we are building works correctly. This is normally done manually with informal tests, for example, checking a site visually on a web browser - or using `console.log` read out values.

In this module, we will examine `formalised testing` strategies and tools that we use to automate and improve the quality of this testing process. Testing is an area often overlooked or neglected by developers who believe it is a burden to their main goal to produce functional code. In this module, we will learn why this is incorrect and how testing can be both rewarding and enjoyable.
