## Introduction

These days when you create a frontend project you will likely use one of the modern JavaScript frameworks, rather than regular HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

In this lesson we'll look at using regular CSS and Sass in a React app, currently the most widely used JavaScript framework.

The next three lessons will cover:

- The React Bootstrap Library
- CSS Modules
- Styled Components

## Cloning or downloading the example code

After cloning or downloading the example code from the repos, run the following commands in your command line or terminal:

```bash
npm install  
npm run start
```

The first command will install all packages listed in the packages.json file.  
The second command will start the project on a local server, on port 3000 if nothing is already running on that port.

## Introduction to React

Before we can look at the different ways of styling a React app, we need a quick overview of how React works.

In the following video we'll look at how to create a new React app using npx, go over the structure of a React app and create a few basic components.
