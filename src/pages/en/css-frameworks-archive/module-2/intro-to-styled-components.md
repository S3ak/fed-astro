## Introduction

In this lesson, weâ€™ll look at using Styled Components in React.

Styled Components is an example of a CSS-in-JS library, where JavaScript is used to style components. Tagged template literals are used to apply styles in the library.

Similar to CSS Modules, Styled Components results in local rather than global styles, though the library does provide for global styles as well as theming. Both are covered in the video lesson.

To install the Styled Components package run:

```bash
npm install styled-components
```
