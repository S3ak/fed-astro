title: Customising Bootstrap using Sass
description: sample
tags: CSS Frameworks
---

## Introduction

The video in this lesson is an introduction to using Sass to customize Bootstrap itself and then apply custom styles on top of those provided by Bootstrap.

Apart from the other advantages of using Sass, the multiple server requests to fetch all imported CSS files that we encountered in lesson 1 are condensed into one request.

We will see how to provide new values for Bootstrap’s variables by downloading and compiling the source files rather than linking them to the CDN version of the library.

## Lesson Task

### Brief

In this task you will practise customising Bootstrap using Sass.

Use the code you created in the first lesson task, or the example code in [this repo](https://github.com/NoroffFEU/customising-bootstrap-with-sass-lesson-task).

### Process

Download the Bootstrap source files, add them to the project, convert the project to use Sass and provide custom values for at least one of Bootstrap’s variables.

### Example answer

You can find an example solution in the [answer branch](https://github.com/NoroffFEU/customising-bootstrap-with-sass-lesson-task/tree/answer) of the repo.
