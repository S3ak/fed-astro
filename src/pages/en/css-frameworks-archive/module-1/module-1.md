Welcome to the CSS Framework course.

In this module we will be looking at Bootstrap which is a popular framework for quickly developing responsive websites and adding popular functionality quickly to your website.

We will also be looking at Sass which is a CSS preprocessor that helps you write CSS efficiently and organize your styles.

Finally weâ€™ll look at BEM which is a way to write and structure CSS. If anything is unclear, check your progression plan, and/or contact a tutor on the forums.
