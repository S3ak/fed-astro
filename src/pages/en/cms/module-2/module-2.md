This module will look at how we can go beyond just using the WordPress admin panel to control our website. Because WordPress is written in PHP, we’ll start with an introduction to understanding what the code is doing when working with the PHP files.

After that, we’ll explore child themes. Child themes are critical because they allow us to control our site’s styling and layout in more advanced ways and ensure our site’s core theme can be updated without overriding our changes.

Finally, we’ll look at the WordPress REST API and see how we can use the content publishing on the WordPress admin panel as a Headless CMS. Until now in the programme, you’ve been using APIs controlled by other developers, but by using the WordPress REST API, we can create and control our own APIs.
