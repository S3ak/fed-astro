In this module, we’ll look at Content Management Systems in general and where we use them. We’ll then focus on WordPress and start by installing a local version of WordPress on our computers before exploring the site administration and creating various content types using the WordPress admin panel. Finally, we’ll explore how to use themes to update the style of our website.
