The three pillars of web development are:

- HTML for writing content
- CSS for styling the content
- JavaScript for making it interactive

In this course we will be looking at HTML and CSS.

Web development is constantly evolving and new techniques for creating ever more complex layouts are being developed. It’s important that you have under the belt the core principles in place to know how to structure your HTML semantically, and write CSS that follows the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle.

There is a lot to learn, especially with CSS. We won’t be able to cover every possible CSS property in these modules, but they will give you the basis from which to work and be able to find the specific property you need for your web design.

By the end of this course you will need to have built the website you designed in Design 1. The daily tasks are there to keep you on track to deliver the website by the time you have finished. If you want feedback on your site as you are developing it, please message your tutors.

If anything is unclear, check your progression plan, and/or contact a tutor on the forums.
