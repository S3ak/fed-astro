In this module we look at specific elements and how to style them. These will include adding and styling images and icons to make your page look better and more engaging.

We will also look at forms as a way to collect user input. Then we will cover navigation - a vital part of any site; this will include learning how to make a mobile ‘hamburger’ menu using only CSS.

Finally, we will look at the CSS Box Model which defines how elements that display as blocks can have padding, margin, and borders added around them.
