In this module we will start by looking at bug fixing. Fixing bugs is a big part of what we do as developers. It shouldn’t be seen as a failure that you get bugs. It’s a natural part of the process. As you become more experienced as a developer, you’ll learn to avoid making certain mistakes and get better at finding what went wrong, but debugging will always be a part of your process. As a part of debugging we will be looking at how to use your developer tools.

We then move on to animations and transitions which is a great way of making your site more interesting and engaging. Try not to make the site too busy, and always ensure the CSS you’re adding enhances the user’s experience.

After that we move on to CSS Variables which is a great way of reducing the amount of code you need to write in your CSS, as well as meaning that you have less places you need to look to update your CSS.

Finally, we’ll look at common responsive layouts and how to build them.
