## Introduction

React is a library; this means we can add it to a library and use it in existing applications. It, however, doesnâ€™t include any tooling, such as build tools, meaning that you still need to add a lot of setup before you can use it effectively.

React developers created a tool called `create-react-app` (also called CRA for short) which creates a basic React app with tooling already setup so you can jump straight into developing.

In addition, `create-react-app` also provides different templates, such as a TypeScript template, allowing you to quickstart a TypeScript React app. You can also create your own templates.

## Creating a new app with `create-react-app`

Using `create-react-app` is very simple.

The syntax is as follows, which you run in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-first-app
```

This command will create a new `create-react-app` inside a new folder where you ran the command.

`my-first-app` above is the name of the folder that will be generated for your app. You can change this to whatever you'd like; however, you must have lowercase letters and not include any spaces.

Run the `create-react-app` command above, and we will then begin exploring the app.

## Exploring the app

Once the app has finished installing, open the folder of the new app in VS Code.

### Running the app

Let's run the app now to see it in action.

In a terminal in the same folder of the app, run the command:

```bash
npm run start
```

The app will now run a development server in the terminal and eventually open a browser window with the app once it's done. If it doesn't open a browser window, then open a browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal; this is usually http://localhost:3000/.

Once your app is running, you will see something like the image below:

![CRA package.json](../images/front-end-frameworks/module-1/cra-app-running.png)

It is important that you keep an eye on this terminal when developing, as errors will be shown in this terminal. It would be best to also have the console open in your browser, as errors might also be shown here.

> **NOTE:** You need to keep this development window open at all times when developing on your React app. When you are done for the day, you can close the terminal, and then when you start working on your app again, you simply run the `npm run start` command again.

### `package.json`

Open the `package.json` file so we can look at the contents of the file.

![CRA package.json](../images/front-end-frameworks/module-1/cra-package.json.png)

#### Dependencies

Between lines 5 and 13 of the screenshot, you will see the dependencies that the CRA app is using:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
  },
```

`react`: This is the core library of React.

`react-dom`: This is the library that lets React write to the DOM.

`react-scripts`: This library is for the React scripts that make it easier to use React.

`@testing-library`: These libraries are for writing React tests.

#### Scripts

Between lines 14 and 19 of the screenshot, you will see the scripts available for you to use.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
```

`start`: This is to run the development server of React. You'll quite often see this script renamed to `dev` so it's clearer that it starts the development server.

`build`: This command is used to build the actual React app when deploying it. This build version won't contain the debug features present when using the `start` command.

`test`: This command runs the tests you have written for your React app.

`eject`: This command will unpack your entire app so you can make advanced configurations. You will likely never need to run this command. This action cannot be reversed, so do not run it unless you are 100% sure you know what you're trying to do.

### File structure

In VS Code, navigate to the `src` folder.

The two files we are interested in are `index.js` and `App.js`

`index.js`: This is the entry point for our app and is where we specify the HTML element that React will render in. You typically don't need to do anything in this file.

`App.js`: This is our main App component. It contains what we are seeing on the screen.

## SPA (Single-Page Application)

React is a SPA.

This means that it will load only a single HTML page and then use JavaScript to dynamically change the content of this HTML file.

Open the `public` folder, and inside, you will see an empty div with an id of `root` inside of the `<body>` :

```html
<div id="root"></div>
```

React will load this HTML page once and then render content dynamically in this `div`.

If you have a look at the `index.js` file, you will see where React selects this `div` and then renders our `<App>` component into it:

```jsx
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
```

## Lesson task

### Goal

The student will learn to use the `create-react-app` tool to create an app, start the development server for the app, and then make a minor change to the app.

### Brief

You will use the CRA tool to create a new app in the directory `my-first-app`. After this, you will start the development. You will then modify the app to display text of your choice.

### Level 1 process

1. Navigate to the folder that contains all of your projects. Do not create a folder for the app; this will automatically be done for you.

2. Open a terminal in the above folder that contains all of your projects.

3. Run the following command in the terminal to create a CRA app: `npx create-react-app my-first-app`

4. Once the installation is done, open the `my-first-app` folder in VS Code.

5. In the terminal, navigate to the `my-first-app` folder and run `npm run start`. This will start the development server. Once it is started, your browser should open your app, which will display a spinning React logo.

6. In VS Code, navigate to the `App.js` file and delete everything inside of the file. Then copy and paste the following into the file and save the file:

```jsx
import React from "react";

function App() {
  return <div>Hello world</div>;
}

export default App;
```

7. You should now see `Hello world` on a white background displayed on the page.

8. Change `Hello world` to any text you'd like and save the file. You should then see the text change to what you have written.

9. Feel free to experiment by adding different elements and saving the file.
