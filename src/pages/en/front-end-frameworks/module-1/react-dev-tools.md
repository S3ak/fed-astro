## Introduction

React developers have created a browser extension called `React Developer Tools` that help debug your React apps.

## Installation of React Developer Tools

1. Head to the extensions page for your relevant browser.

Chrome: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)

Firefox: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/)

2. Search for `react developer tools` and install it.

Once it's installed, you will need to close all instances of your browser and reopen it.

You should then find two new tabs called `Components` and `Profiler`. The one you'll be most interested in at this stage is `Components`. You can drag this tab to be closer to other Browser developer tool tabs that are used more frequently, e.g. Elements and Console.

## Using the React Developer Tools

Using the React Developer Tools is similar to using the Inspect Element.

You can select an element, but instead of it being an element, it's a component within the app.

On the right-hand side, you can see the state and props for that component.

This lets you easily see what is happening in a component without having to always use `console.log`.
