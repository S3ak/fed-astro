Welcome to the JavaScript Frameworks course!

In this course, we will look at the React front-end framework, starting with the basics and moving on to advanced concepts. Weâ€™ll learn about theory and then apply these concepts in practical ways so you can understand how they might be used in the workplace.

This first module will look at front-end frameworks, what React is and the features React provides.
