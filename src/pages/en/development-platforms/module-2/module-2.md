In this module, we will discuss different types of web hosting services, including shared hosting, dedicated hosting, virtual private servers (VPS), cloud hosting, static website hosting, and specialist hosting. We will also take a brief look at the history of web hosting, different methods of deploying code to a server, and the importance of consulting server logs when debugging issues.

We will look at what DNS (Domain Name System) is and its history, provide a brief overview of CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) and explore some command line networking tools.

We will examine the concept of Backend as a Service (BaaS) and how it can be used to speed up web application development. We will look at popular BaaS providers like Google Firebase and AWS Amplify, as well as free and open-source options like Supabase and AppWrite. Because the BaaS world is rapidly evolving, we provide only a brief overview of the services, and it's always necessary to consult the official documentation for up-to-date information.

Finally, we will look at some starter code and file arrangement for a vanilla JS single-page app (SPA) that utilises a BaaS for its backend. No provider-specific code is included; it is just one of many ways you could potentially arrange a vanilla JS frontend project.
