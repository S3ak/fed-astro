## Introduction

This guide is designed to help students collaborate with each other and their teachers to produce development platform case studies.

## Format

Case Studies are accepted in two formats:

1. A [markdown](http://markdown.com) document
2. A [YouTube](http://youtube.com) video embed

### Markdown

Please submit a markdown document using this [format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoroffFEU/development-platforms/main/example-case-study.md) as a structure.

You may include images in your case study, but please be wary of copyright restrictions. If you are unsure about the copyright status of an image, please contact your coach.

### YouTube

YouTube videos should attempt to follow the same structure as the markdown document. However, there may be more cause to deviate from this depending on the subject.

When viewing your YouTube video, select `Share` and then `Embed`. Copy the code from the `Embed` tab and paste it into your markdown document.

Please submit a markdown document using this [format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoroffFEU/development-platforms/main/example-video-case-study.md).

## Review

Use of the Peer Review forum is optional but highly recommended. You may also wish to request peer review via Discord. As the target audience for your case study are development students, peer review should provide valuable feedback.

Coach review is available up to 5 days before the final deadline. Please be specific about which aspects of your case study you want feedback on to maximise the utility of this process. To request coach review, open a Pull Request and request a review as detailed below.
