In this module we will be looking at Array and Object methods. They are one of the most important parts of learning to code in JavaScript, and can significantly reduce the complexity of your code.

You will be looking at the following:

- `map` array method
- `filter` array method
- `reduce` array method
- `find`/`findIndex` array method
- `some`/`every` array method
- Object methods and using array methods on objects
- Chaining array methods
- Best practices when using array methods

If anything is unclear, check your progression plan, and/or contact a tutor.
