## Introduction

Projects comprise of a large number of activities that are to be completed on time before the project can officially be declared completed. To manage these activities and ensuring they finish on time is a skill, which is known as project management. The last thing you would want is to miss the deadline or finish a task out of sequence, as it could adversely affect your project as a whole. It could increase costs, cause problems with the clients, and more. Project managers must therefore be able to keep an eye on every task or activity that is to be performed, and also be able to prioritize activities accordingly.

This job is made easier with the help of Gantt charts, as they convey this information visually. Gantt charts outline every task that is a part of the project along with their order against a timescale. This allows a project manager to gain an instant overview of the project, the tasks related to it, and deadlines for each of these tasks.

## Gantt Charts

When a Gantt chart is set up, you need to consider every task that is a part of your project. You will also have to decide the ideal person who is going to be responsible for every task, the time limit for each task, and the potential risks your team may face. This comprehensive way of thinking helps you ensure that the schedule is ideal, the correct people are assigned to every task, and that you possess the right remedies for potential risks you may encounter before you even begin.

They also allow you to come up with practical aspects of a project, such as the minimum time required to finish the project, what tasks are pre-requisites for other tasks, and so on. Moreover, you can also use them to figure out the critical path or the series of tasks which must be finished on time individually in order to ensure that the project is delivered on time.

To conclude, you can always also use Gantt charts to keep the sponsors and team members involved in the project updated . All you are supposed to do is update the chart and display the schedule changes along with their implications, or simply use it to share around the key tasks that were successfully completed.

### Gantt chart advantages

Gantt charts come with a wide range of benefits, but the five most significant reasons to use Gantt charts have been mentioned below:

**1. Circumvent completion confusion**: Gantt charts allow users to stay on track by granting a visual timeline displaying the start and finish for each task. Since the key dates and milestones are all noticeable on the visual overview of these charts, it becomes easier to maintain timescale-based tasks and deliverables as they can be tracked on a yearly, monthly, weekly or even a daily basis. The diagram given below shows the benefit of visualization offered by Gantt charts:

**2. Keeping everyone on the same page**: Whenever a visual framework for a certain project exists, the chances of misunderstanding and other related conflicts lower substantially. Thanks to Gantt charts, every shareholder receives the same set of information and can declare mutually understood expectations, allowing developers to carry out their tasks in accordance with the protocol.

**3. Acknowledging task relationships**: The charts improve transparency by clearly displaying interrelation between various tasks and which tasks rely on the completion of another to achieve a certain objective. These task relationships can be hard to understand, as they require one to understand the accurate timing of each task and the way one task impacts the other, along with their interdependence. With Gantt charts, one can assure the best workflow as task relationships become easier to understand, improving productivity and success rates.

**4. Effective resource allocation**: With one glance at the Gantt chart, users can distinguish between resource locations and hence be able to allocate or share resources effectively, utilizing the available resources to their fullest extent. The better one manages to study and follow the chart, the better the chances of them being able to keep project costs under the given budget and ensure on-time completion.

**5. Get a handle on the future**: Gantt charts not only allow one to focus on day-to-day progress. They allow project managers to look much further ahead in order to make decisions and make sure the project is heading towards the right direction, i.e. in accordance with the company’s long-term strategic objectives.

## Limitations of Gantt Charts

Even though Gantt charts help project managers and decision makers with various issues and smoothing the whole process, they fail to tend to several issues. Gantt charts fail to offer quick solutions when it comes to issues being caused by unforeseen events, making it an inflexible project management system. Moreover, it may be a hassle to keep updating the chart consistently, or even expect teammates to update their own charts on a regular basis. Finally, Gantt charts do not emphasize task expectations or purpose; it solely displays how far along a project will reach at a certain point in the future.

However, the advantages of Gantt charts usually overshadow the limitations, which is why it is preferred by all types of companies. Gantt charts also help one to plan and schedule projects, helping you understand how long a project requires before it is completed, figure out what resources are needed and prioritize tasks in an orderly manner. Task dependencies can also be managed with their help.

Gantt charts also allow project managers and decision makers to keep an eye on the progress after a project is underway. It allows them to figure out what should have been achieved by a certain date, and what has been achieved. If you feel like the project is lagging on the schedule, you can always perform the necessary actions to bring it back on track. This would not have been possible without the Gantt chart, and even if it were, it would have been a difficult manual task.

## Tools for Gantt Charts

### Microsoft Project

Microsoft Office has stated that “The Gantt Chart view is the most commonly used view in Microsoft Office Project 2007”. This tool grants the users a Gantt chart wizard and allows project managers to make their own charts. Microsoft Project is hence a durable program which may work for a company of any scale.

### Gantter

Gantter is a cloud-based solution for project managers. It comes with various Google app integrations such as Google Drive. However, it does not offer a lot of unique features and is suggested to be solely used as a charting tool.

### Merlin 2

Merlin 2 is known for its friendly and smooth user interface, offering great customizability while keeping the whole interface simple. It offers the features that are needed and avoids cluttering the interface with too many unneeded features. It runs only on Mac OS X version 10.4.9 or newer (10.6.4 or newer is recommended). Merlin 2 comes with powerful collaboration features and helps maintain effective Gantt charts, allowing all users to update their project statuses constantly. Merlin 2 has proven to be impactful for large teams facing complicated communication problems.

### GanttProject

This is a free of cost, open-source project management software option, and is robust. It has also been compared to Microsoft Project in that it offers similar features and complexity to its users. As the name itself suggests, Gantt Project emphasizes on producing the right Gantt charts. However, for users attempting to work on larger projects, Gantt Project can get a bit confusing. It is hence recommended to use Gantt Project for small to medium sized projects only.

### Microsoft Excel

Microsoft Excel can also be a simple but effective tool to create Gantt Charts. You can easily fill cells with color to make a timeline for your chart. If you're finding the more sophisticated software options daunting, then try using Excel.

Gantt charts do the job for most project managers by effectively providing a visual representation of the start and end points of a project. The team members can use Gantt charts to keep themselves updated on the progress achieved so far on a project, how long each task may take to accomplish, and the overall minimum time required to finish the project.
