## Project Manager

Before we dive into the systems development life cycle, it helps to have an understanding of what a project manager is and what role they play. A project manager’s role is to ensure that all stakeholders in the project are kept informed regularly about the progress of the project. The stakeholders can range from:

- Executives
- Business Head of Departments
- Technical Heads of Departments
- Financial Managers
- Project Team

As you can see from the above list, the stakeholders vary, and each stakeholder is only concerned with how the project affects their department. Therefore, it is very important for a project manager to deliver updates which are understandable to all parties.

It is typical for a project manager to hold weekly meetings involving all stakeholders that give an update on the project's progress and report on any milestones met.

The key aspect of the project manager is to define the deliverables to create corporate awareness relating to your project. Selecting the correct milestones for the project is of utmost importance as this is where all stakeholders agree to the project scope and the timeline of all deliverables.

Once the project manager’s milestones have been agreed upon and signed off by all stakeholders, the next big challenge is to incorporate these milestones with the systems development life cycle.

## Systems development life cycle (SDLC)

Now that we know about the role of a typical project manager, let us see how the project manager’s role moves over to the systems development life cycle and just how important it is to properly plan a development project.

Project management in the SDLC has 4 phases, namely:

- Requirements
- Design
- Construction
- Implementation

Each of the different phases above has their own role player who contributes to the successful execution of the project.

## Requirements

When planning a project, it’s vital to know what the requirements are for the project. What are the ‘must-haves’ for the project, and what are ‘nice-to-haves’. These requirements are gathered by talking to the stakeholders.

### Produce Functional Specifications

Once you have gathered the requirements you will then compile a document known as a functional specification or a functional spec. The functional spec will contain all the necessary details needed for the developers to develop the system according to the requirements of the customer.

A functional spec should tell the developers what to build and code; tell those testing the solution what it's supposed to do; and let the client/stakeholder know what they're going to be receiving.

There are a few ways of writing functional specifications, and we’ll discuss three different approaches below.

### System Must

This approach sets the requirements as what the system must be able to do. This is a fairly clean and clear way of setting out requirements, but what it gains in clarity it can lose a bit in nuance and can become somewhat ambiguous.

For a contact form, the functional requirements might be:

- The system must allow the user to input text.
- The system must validate the email address.

### Use case

A use case puts functionalities into a series of steps which allows developers to get a more rounded perspective of the requirements. Often ‘system must’ requirements are formulated into a use case.

- A user arrives to the contact page and fills in the form. If the inputs are all valid, the data is sent to the contact inbox and the user receives a message confirming the message has been sent.

### User stories

User stories give great insight into the user’s perspective for identifying functionalities. It uses a simple construction which makes it easy to access for developers and stakeholders alike and lets them decide what is and isn’t important for the user.

A common construction of a user story is:

“As a < type of user >, I can < perform an action > so that < I can get a benefit >”

- As a potential customer I can send valid form data so that I can find out more about the product

## Design

Once the functional specifications have been set, it needs to be decided how to develop the solution for the requirements.

A Technical Specification is created by developers to show all the technical requirements needed to achieve the project. It lists the layout of the architectural design, hardware, software and any special coding requirements. A technical specification should be updated regularly as it is viewed by all developers.

This document is created to show how the system will be designed and developed and becomes very useful when many systems are being integrated.

As part of their planning the developers and system architects will discuss the impact to new and existing infrastructure and databases and use UML (Unified Modelling Language) to visualize the design of the system.

## Construction

### Build System Components

Once we have completed the functional and technical requirements for the system design, we can start developing. The developer will now use the functional and technical specifications to build the system based on the requirements.

### System Testing

Once the developer has completed the development, the developer will do systems testing in order to make sure that the solution they built is working. This is done before the developer hands the system over to the testers, who will then perform full testing.

It is good practice for the developer to test the solution while they are developing in order to fix any bugs which might be found and can then be fixed right there and then. It is also good practice for the developer to sit with the business analyst to test the solution. This will ensure that the requirements have been met.

### Produce Technical Documentation

Once the developer has finalized the development and development testing, they will create or update the technical documentation. This is updated regularly as system and code changes are done. This is a very good document to have as any developer can use it as a point of reference for developing and allowing the developer to understand the system better.

## Implementation

During the Implementation phase, the product is created. This means the product finally becomes tangible, and this can be an exciting milestone for the customer. This phase includes testing and installation - all while following the technical specification document.

## SDLC Methodologies

Systems devlopment life Cycle(SDLC) can be categories into different methodologies/processes. The methodologies include:

- Waterfall
- V-Models
- Agile
- Prototyping
- Iterative and Incremental development
- etc.

Most modern software development processes can be vaguely classify as Agile. Hence we explore Agile Methodology.

## Lesson Task

### Brief

Project management and the SDLC can sometimes be an overwhelming mass of information. Use this task to better understand these 2 concepts by creating clear templates and answers that you can understand for yourself.

### Level 1 Process

1. Create a template for a project management plan according to the SDLC that is easy for you to understand.
2. Create a template for a functional specification.

### Level 2 Process

1. Briefly describe the role of the project manager.
2. Briefly describe the role of a business analyst.
