This is a short, but important course where you will be introduced to basic principles of project development and useful working methods. These tools will give you an opportunity to work more effectively and transparently. At first you will use them in study assignments and later also in real customer projects.

If anything is unclear, check your progression plan and/or contact a tutor on the forums.
