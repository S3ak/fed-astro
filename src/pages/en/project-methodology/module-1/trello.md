## Introduction

Trello is:

- A popular and useful project management tool.
- Simple and easy to follow.
- Great for working with increasing communication about who in a team is doing what.

Start by signing up for a free account on [https://trello.com](https://trello.com/)

## Trello

#### Boards

A board is usually set up for a project. This could be a short-term or ongoing project.

An example of a board might be ‘Build Website for Pizza Palace’, or if you use Trello to keep track of personal tasks ‘DIY Projects’.

You can add team members to a board and decide which team members are a part of which board.

#### Lists

Lists keep cards organised so that you know where each task is in the process. Examples of a set of lists might be To Do, Doing, and Done. As you progress with the project, you will move cards between the lists.

#### Cards

Cards are individual tasks that need completing in the project.

These tasks:

- can be assigned members who oversee that task.
- can be given a due date for when it needs to be completed.
- can be descriptions and labels to keep track of the card content.

### Simplicity

The setup with Trello is very simple and there is not much more that you need to know about working with it. If you are interested in learning about some of the advanced features, [watch this video on LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/trello-for-agile-teams/work-collaboratively-in-agile-teams-with-trello?u=43268076). This is not, however, a requirement. The beauty of Trello is its simplicity, and how quickly it can help you to organise a project.

## Lesson Task

### Brief

Make a Trello board for a personal project or tasks that you need to keep track of in your life. It could be something like DIY projects, or a meal plan, or a website you’ve been wanting to build. It’s up to you.

Sign up for a Trello account, and create a board and tasks for the project. You can consider setting deadlines for tasks and assigning members to tasks.
