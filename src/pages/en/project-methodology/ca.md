## Goal

To show-case the skills learned over the Project Methodology course as well as plan ahead for your Semester Project 1.

## Brief

You have been tasked with planning for your Semester Project 1. You will receive the full brief when you start the Semester Project 1, but here are some of the functional specifications so that you know what will be required.

- The website shall be neatly designed and should appeal to the target audience.
- A GitHub repository will be set up and the site deployed on Netlify.
- The website shall have 4 to 6 pages and be responsive across screen sizes
- The HTML shall be neat and semantic, and the CSS shall follow the DRY principle.
- The site shall follow WCAG and SEO guidelines.
- A report documenting the process and explaining decisions will be delivered.

You will have 4 weeks (full-time) and 8 weeks (part-time) to build the Semester Project 1.

## Level 1 Process

1. Choose either a Gantt chart or a Trello board for planning out your project.
2. Consider the tasks you will need to complete the project and add them to either the Gantt chart or your Trello board.
3. Choose the deadlines for the tasks and add to your Gantt chart or Trello cards. Based on your experience thus far, you can estimate how long each task will take you. Once you receive the full brief you might want to make some adjustments.
4. Write a report of 500-1000 words explaining why you chose the project planning tool you did. Also explain the chosen tasks and plan for your project. Please use the report template provided below.
5. Add your Gantt chart or a screenshot of your Trello board to the report you submit.
