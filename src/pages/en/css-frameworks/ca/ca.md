## Goal

To apply knowledge of Bootstrap and SASS to build a responsive front end for a social media application.

## Brief

You are tasked with creating 3 pages in HTML using Bootstrap and SASS:

1. Homepage
2. Profile page
3. Login page

The Homepage should have a feed of posts from the user’s contacts, a search bar, and a form to create a new post.

The profile page should have a profile image, details about the user, a list of the user’s contacts, their posts and a form to post to their wall.

The login page should have a form to login to the application. Make sure to include HTML form validation and use `/profile` as the action attribute.

You will only be working on the visuals for this project at this stage, forms do not need to submit data, for example.

Submission for this project will follow the pattern used in professional development. You are required to seek feedback from your peers as well as the teachers in order to complete this assignment.

## Process

1. Create a design or wireframe for each page
2. Create a new public repository on GitHub
3. Create a new project folder for this repository
4. Create a new git branch for this project
5. Create a `package.json` file
6. Install Bootstrap, SASS and Live Server
7. Configure NPM scripts in `package.json`
8. Implement your design using Bootstrap and SASS overrides
9. Create a Pull Request to merge your changes to the main branch
10. Share this Pull Request and request peer review
11. Discuss and implement the feedback gathered from peer review
12. Share this Pull Request with a teacher for their approval
13. Complete the approved Pull Request, or implement the required changes

## Delivery

For peer review, please submit a link to your repository to the Moodle forum. You should review 2 of your peers' submissions.

Please submit your public GitHub repository URL along with any supplementary files such as wireframes. Your repo should have an active PR that the teachers will review.

Design files will not be included in your grade but help to provide additional context to the marker.

> Please make sure to exclude `node_modules` by using a `.gitignore` file.
